# How to make a zettle entry

This is the body of the zettle (which means "slip").

* First Bullet
* Second Bullet

But when I have an ordered list or a numbered list,

1. First item
2. Second item

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.println("Hello world!")
}
```
What if I want *italic* or **bold** or ***bolditalic***

How about something that look like `code`?

And when I have a url, I want it to print also so I always write it out like this

https://rwx.gg

* I put references at the bottom
